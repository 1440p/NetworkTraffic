# NetworkTraffic
This is a Network Traffic Lab for DFSC2136 / DF and IA Fundamentals II

All that needs to be done is to place NetworkTraffic.tar.gz and NetworkTraffic.sh in Downloads directory

Pull up terminal, cd into Downloads, then call

$ bash NetworkTraffic.sh

you can actually call/place NetworkTraffic.sh from any directory you want, so long as the gzip is in Downloads
